Mobile Phone Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting mobile phone prices based on various hardware specifications and features. Using a dataset containing information on numerous mobile phones, we've developed a machine learning model that can estimate prices with high accuracy.
Key Components
Dataset: Contains features such as RAM, internal memory, screen resolution (PPI), battery capacity, camera specifications, CPU details, weight, and thickness.
Model: A Random Forest Regressor was implemented in Google Colab, which showed exceptional performance with an RÂ² score of 0.97, indicating that 97% of the variance in mobile phone prices is explained by the model.
Feature Importance: Analysis revealed that RAM, screen resolution (PPI), and internal memory are the most significant predictors of price, while factors like weight and CPU core count have relatively less impact.
Applications
This model can be used by:
Consumers to estimate fair prices for new or used phones
Manufacturers to price new models competitively
Retailers to analyze market pricing trends
Researchers studying the mobile phone market dynamics
The project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively analyze complex relationships between hardware specifications and pricing in the mobile phone industry.
